"""Defines an occupancy model that returns the average number of occupants.

Occupancy refers to the average number of people in a zone within a specified
period of time. Concrete classes can either simulate the occupancy or
estimate the occupancy from Calendar or motion sensors in the buildings.

The occupancy signal is an input to the agent's reward function.
